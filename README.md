### Introduction

Welcome to MoveFlix API, the server-side component of the MoveFlix web application. This project is part of my Fullstack Development journey at CareerFoundry, representing my Achievement 2. The MoveFlix API allows users to access information about movies, directors, and genres. Users can sign up, update personal information, and create a list of favorite movies.
In upcoming Achievement 3 i am building the frontend for my MoveFlix Web App with REACT, so alltogether a MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js and REACT) Application.
Kindly be aware that, as a learner, there might be occasional bugs, and your understanding is appreciated.
